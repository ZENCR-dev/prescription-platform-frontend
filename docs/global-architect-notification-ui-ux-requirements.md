# üìÆ Global Architect Notification: UI/UX User Participation Requirements

**To**: Global Architect  
**From**: Frontend Lead  
**Date**: 2025-08-29  
**Subject**: Layer 2 UI/UX Component Decomposition Requirements Implementation

---

## Executive Summary

Frontend workspace has implemented mandatory user participation requirements for UI/UX Component decomposition at Layer 2. This ensures user feedback is systematically incorporated into the development process before implementation begins.

## Implemented Changes

### 1. Governance Documents Updated
- **PLANNING.md**: Added Layer 2 UI/UX Component Decomposition Requirements section
- **.claude/CLAUDE.md**: Added Frontend Lead Layer 2 execution rules
- **PRP-M1.2**: Updated Component 3 from 5 to 7 Dev-Steps with user participation phases

### 2. New Requirements Pattern
```yaml
UI/UX Component Standard Pattern:
  Analysis Phase: 1-2 Dev-Steps (requirements & prototyping)
  User Participation 1: 1 Dev-Step (prototype review & feedback)
  Implementation Phase: 2-3 Dev-Steps (component development)
  User Participation 2: 1 Dev-Step (UI testing & optimization)
  Completion Phase: 1 Dev-Step (final polish & documentation)
```

### 3. Execution Tools
- `/sc:improve --loop --interactive` for iterative design cycles
- HTML prototypes required before implementation
- User feedback documentation in PRP-MX.Y_LOG.md

## üéØ Recommendations for Global Architect

### For Future PRP Documents

When creating PRP documents for frontend workspace that include UI/UX components, please consider:

#### Option 1: Include in Architect Zone (Recommended)
Add a section in the **Architect Zone** specifying UI/UX user participation requirements:
```markdown
### **UI/UX Development Requirements**
- **User Participation**: MANDATORY for all UI/UX Components
- **Minimum Feedback Cycles**: 2 per UI/UX Component
- **Prototype Review**: Required before implementation begins
- **User Testing**: Required before component completion
```

#### Option 2: Explicit Component Breakdown
When defining Components in the PRP, explicitly mark UI/UX components:
```markdown
#### **Component X: [UI/UX Component Name]** (X Dev-Steps)
**User Participation Required**: Yes - 2 feedback cycles
- Dev-Step X.1: Analysis and prototyping
- Dev-Step X.2: „ÄêUser Participation„ÄëPrototype review
- Dev-Step X.3-X.5: Implementation
- Dev-Step X.6: „ÄêUser Participation„ÄëUser testing
- Dev-Step X.7: Final optimization
```

#### Option 3: Global Directive in PRP Template
Consider updating the PRP template (PRP-M0-vX.X) to include a standard section for UI/UX requirements, making it a default consideration for all frontend PRPs.

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Quality Assurance**: User feedback before implementation reduces rework
2. **User-Centered Design**: Ensures actual user needs are met, not assumptions
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Early prototype validation prevents costly late-stage changes
4. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Clear user participation phases improve communication
5. **Compliance**: Aligns with medical platform UX requirements for professional interfaces

## Impact on Timeline

- UI/UX Components will typically require 2 additional Dev-Steps
- However, this front-loaded user validation reduces overall development time by preventing rework
- Estimated net impact: 10-20% initial increase, 30-40% reduction in post-implementation changes

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Component 3 of M1.2 will follow the new pattern (7 Dev-Steps instead of 5)
2. **Future PRPs**: Request Global Architect consideration for including UI/UX requirements in PRP documents
3. **Template Update**: Suggest PRP template enhancement for standardization

## Conclusion

The Frontend workspace is committed to delivering high-quality, user-validated UI/UX components. By incorporating user participation at the Layer 2 Component decomposition level, we ensure that the platform meets the actual needs of TCM practitioners and pharmacies.

We request Global Architect support in formalizing these requirements in future PRP distributions to ensure consistency across all frontend UI/UX development tasks.

**Frontend Lead Status**: Ready to execute Component 3 of M1.2 with the new user participation pattern.
