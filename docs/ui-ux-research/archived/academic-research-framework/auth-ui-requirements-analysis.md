3. Identify training and onboarding requirements

### 3.2 Research Methods

#### Qualitative Methods
1. **User Interviews** (5-7 per user role)
   - Semi-structured interviews
   - 30-45 minutes duration
   - Focus on current pain points and ideal solutions

2. **Contextual Inquiry**
   - Observe users in their work environment
   - Understand actual vs. reported behaviors
   - Identify environmental constraints

3. **Card Sorting**
   - Information architecture validation
   - Feature prioritization
   - Navigation preference testing

#### Quantitative Methods
1. **Survey Distribution** (Target: 50+ responses)
   - Authentication preference questionnaire
   - Security comfort level assessment
   - Feature importance ranking

2. **Analytics Review** (If available)
   - Current system usage patterns
   - Common error points
   - Drop-off analysis

### 3.3 Participant Recruitment Criteria

## 4. üé® Design Hypothesis and Assumptions

### 4.1 Initial Design Hypothesis

#### For TCM Practitioners
"A streamlined, single-page login with biometric options will reduce authentication time by 50% and increase daily active usage."

#### For Pharmacy Staff
"Role-based visual differentiation and quick-switch accounts will improve shift handover efficiency by 30%."

#### For Administrators
"Comprehensive security dashboard with MFA enforcement will increase compliance confidence by 40%."

### 4.2 Key Assumptions to Validate

1. **Technology Assumptions**
   - Users have access to smartphones for MFA
   - Stable internet connectivity available
   - Modern browser usage (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

2. **Workflow Assumptions**
   - Users prefer persistent sessions during work hours
   - Role switching is uncommon within sessions
   - Password managers are acceptable

3. **Security Assumptions**
   - Users willing to adopt MFA for security
   - Biometric authentication is trusted
   - Session timeouts are acceptable interruptions
