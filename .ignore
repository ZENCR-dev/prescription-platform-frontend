# while maintaining Git security by keeping them out of version control

# IDE Configuration Notes:
# - VS Code: Add ".ignore" support via extensions if needed
# - JetBrains IDEs: Configure file patterns in Settings > Editor > File Types
# - Vim/Neovim: Add appropriate configurations for file access

# Security Note:
# This whitelist ensures local development convenience while preventing
# sensitive documents from being committed to Git repository
